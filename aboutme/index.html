            <p>I am a father to two amazing girls that I enjoy spending time with. 
            I am married to the best thing that has ever happended to me. She is also a faithful member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints. 
            We are both Nigerians who live in the ancient city of Owerri, Imo State. I and sister Okonkwo are grateful for the opportunity to grow in knowledge and in spirit through BYU. 
            This also motivated us to offer to serve as BYUpathway missionaries to support many other saint in their quest.</p>
            <p>I am a Medical laboratory scientist and Public Health Specialist by profession, 
            with special interest in supply chain management of public health commodities, 
            but I feel there is alot more about me that I am yet to discover and explore.</p>
